<h1>Description</h1>

RS-PDF is the software library which is exploited by RS_Server to actually edit the PDF files to add the URL required when a reader requests to save for later the publication that he is reading. It is a software characterized by a command line interface and this means that RS_Server can use it directly since they are deployed one along the other, without using complex communication channels and paradigms.
